# Why choose Solana?

At a time when some blockchain networks can only boast of just 15 transactions per second, adoption of the technology seems impossible as the delay in transaction processing poses a huge threat to business success. Solana system is working towards a blockchain network that provides a higher transaction speed of about 65,000 transactions per second. Like almost any blockchain system today, Solana is still very new and not without controversy.

## Overview of Solana Documentation

The Solana docs are used to describe the Solana open source project. They explain the usefulness of Solana, how it works and how to use Solana. The solana system demonstrate that there is a set of software algorithm when used in the blockchain allow transactional scalabilty within the network bandwidth.

The system satisfies all three essential properties of a well-built blockchain: it is secure, decentralized, and scalable. The Solana system also supports the safe and concurrent execution of programs authored in programming languages such as C or Rust.

### What are Sols? <a href="#what-is-a-solana-cluster" id="what-is-a-solana-cluster"></a>

A SOL is the name of Solana's native token, which can be passed to nodes in a Solana cluster in exchange for running an on-chain program or validating its output. The system may perform micropayments of fractional SOLs, which are called _lamports_. They are named in honor of Solana's biggest technical influence, [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie\_Lamport). A lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.
